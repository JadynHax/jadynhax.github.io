This is where the code for my website is located. I figure GitHub Pages is basically just like free hosting and web design (aside from not being able to do server-side scripting, but I'll cut my losses there), so I figure this is a better place than any other to make my website.

You can find the website [here](https://jaonhax.github.io).
